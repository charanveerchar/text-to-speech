# text-to-speech
 using speechSynthesis and html and css
This small project demonstrates how to convert written text into spoken words using the Web Speech API's speechSynthesis interface. It's a simple and interactive way to bring voice output functionality to your website or web app.

⚙️ Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure for the user interface — a heading, a text area for input, and a button to trigger the speech.

CSS: Adds basic styling to center the content and make it more user-friendly.

JavaScript: Handles the logic of converting text to speech using the browser’s built-in speechSynthesis API. 

Note:

💡 How It Works
The user types some text into the textarea.

When the “Speak” button is clicked, the speakText() function is triggered.

This function:

Retrieves the text from the textarea.

Creates a SpeechSynthesisUtterance object with that text.

Calls speechSynthesis.speak() to vocalize the input using the default system voice.

✅ Features
Works in most modern browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

No external libraries required — it's 100% native JavaScript.

Fast, lightweight, and beginner-friendly.

🚀 Possible Enhancements
Add voice selection (male/female, different accents).

Include pitch and rate control sliders.

Display a list of available voices.

Add support for multiple languages.
